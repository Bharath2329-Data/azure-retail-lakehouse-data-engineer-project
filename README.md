Azure Data Factory (Orchestration Layer)

### Azure Resources Created
1️⃣ Azure Data Factory (V2)

Name: adf-retail-lakehouse

Resource Group: rg-retail-lakehouse-bharath

Region: Same as ADLS

System Assigned Managed Identity: Enabled

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

To allow ADF to access ADLS securely:

Assigned Role: Storage Blob Data Contributor

Assigned To: Azure Data Factory Managed Identity

This enables secure, password-less authentication using Azure RBAC.

### Linked Service Configuration

Created Linked Service:

Name: LS_ADLS_RETAIL

Type: Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

Authentication: Managed Identity

Connection Test: Successful

This establishes secure connectivity between ADF and ADLS.

### Datasets Created (Bronze Layer)

The following datasets were configured in ADF:

Dataset Name	Source Path
DS_Bronze_Customers_CSV	bronze/raw/customers/customers.csv
DS_Bronze_Products_CSV	bronze/raw/products/products.csv
DS_Bronze_Stores_CSV	bronze/raw/stores/stores.csv
DS_Bronze_Orders_CSV	bronze/raw/orders/orders.csv
DS_Bronze_OrderItems_CSV	bronze/raw/order_items/order_items.csv
DS_Bronze_Payments_CSV	bronze/raw/payments/payments.csv

Each dataset:

Uses DelimitedText format

Reads from ADLS Gen2

Schema imported from source

Header row enabled

 What This Demonstrates

✔ Azure Data Factory configuration
✔ Managed Identity authentication
✔ Secure RBAC role assignment
✔ Enterprise data connectivity
✔ Dataset design for structured ingestion

This step transitions the project from static storage to orchestrated data engineering.

### ADF Configuration Exported

ADF ARM Template exported and stored in repository:

adf/arm_template/
  ARMTemplateForFactory.json
  ARMTemplateParametersForFactory.json

This enables Infrastructure-as-Code capability and reproducibility.

# Day 4 — Parameterized ADF Pipeline (Reusable Bronze Ingestion)
 Goal

Build a reusable Azure Data Factory (ADF) ingestion pattern using a single parameterized Copy pipeline to load any retail CSV file into the Bronze (raw) layer.

This implements an enterprise-style approach: build once, reuse for all datasets.

## Architecture (Updated)

ADF Parameterized Pipeline (Copy Activity)
⬇
ADLS Gen2 — Bronze Layer (Raw)

## What Was Built
### 1️) Parameterized Datasets (Source + Sink)

Created two ADLS Gen2 DelimitedText datasets with dynamic path support:

DS_ADLS_CSV_SRC_PARAM

DS_ADLS_CSV_SINK_PARAM

Each dataset uses parameters:

pContainer

pFolder

pFileName

This allows reading/writing files without creating separate datasets per table.

### 2️) Reusable Pipeline

Created a parameterized pipeline:

PL_CopyToBronze_Parameterized

Pipeline parameters:

pContainer (example: bronze)

pSourceFolder (example: raw/customers)

pFileName (example: customers.csv)

pTargetFolder (example: raw/customers)

Copy Activity:

Copy_CSV_To_Bronze

This pipeline supports ingestion for all retail datasets by changing parameter values.

### Validation Performed

Executed a Debug run for customers.csv

Confirmed successful copy execution in ADF Monitor

Verified file presence/updates in ADLS Bronze folder

### ADF Configuration Saved to Git

Exported ADF ARM template to track configuration in source control:

adf/arm_template/
  ARMTemplateForFactory.json
  ARMTemplateParametersForFactory.json
### Technologies Used

Azure Data Factory (Copy Activity, Parameterization)

ADLS Gen2 (Bronze Layer)

Managed Identity (RBAC)

GitHub + PowerShell

# Day 5 — Bronze to Silver Transformation (Azure Databricks + Delta Lake)
### Goal

Bronze and Silver storage paths:

Bronze Path
abfss://bronze@retaillakehousebharath.dfs.core.windows.net/

Silver Path
abfss://silver@retaillakehousebharath.dfs.core.windows.net/clean/
### Datasets Processed

The following Bronze datasets were transformed:

Dataset	Description
customers	Customer information and loyalty tiers
products	Product catalog and pricing
stores	Store location details
orders	Order transactions
order_items	Product line items per order
payments	Payment details for orders
#### Transformations Applied

Basic data engineering transformations were implemented:

• Removed duplicate records
• Converted date columns to proper date format
• Cast numeric fields to correct data types
• Added ingestion timestamp (ingest_ts)
• Standardized schema structure

Example transformation:

customers_silver = (
customers_df
.dropDuplicates(["customer_id"])
.withColumn("signup_date", to_date("signup_date"))
.withColumn("ingest_ts", current_timestamp())
)
### Silver Layer Storage (Delta Format)

Processed datasets were written as Delta tables into the Silver layer.

silver/clean/customers
silver/clean/products
silver/clean/stores
silver/clean/orders
silver/clean/order_items
silver/clean/payments

Using Delta Lake provides:

ACID transactions

Schema enforcement

Faster queries

Reliable data versioning

### Data Validation

After transformations:

Row counts were verified

Schema structure confirmed

Data preview validated in Databricks notebook

### Technologies Used

• Azure Databricks
• PySpark
• Delta Lake
• Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

# Day 6 — Gold Layer Analytics (Business Data Marts)
### Goal

Transform curated Silver Delta tables into Gold analytics tables that provide business-ready insights for reporting and dashboards.

The Gold layer contains aggregated, analytics-focused datasets used by business teams.

### Architecture (Updated)

Retail CSV Files
⬇
Azure Data Factory (Ingestion)
⬇
Azure Data Lake Storage — Bronze (Raw Data)
⬇
Azure Databricks (Cleaning & Standardization)
⬇
Azure Data Lake Storage — Silver (Delta Tables)
⬇
Azure Databricks (Business Aggregations)
⬇
Azure Data Lake Storage — Gold (Analytics Tables)

### Gold Analytics Tables Created

The following business metrics were generated from Silver data.

Gold Table	Description
daily_revenue	Total revenue generated per day
sales_by_store_daily	Revenue breakdown by store and date
top_products_daily	Best selling products based on revenue
customer_lifetime_value	Total revenue generated by each customer

These datasets provide insights into sales performance, product trends, and customer value.

### Transformations Applied

The Gold layer performs business aggregations on Silver datasets:

• Join multiple datasets (orders, order_items, products, customers, stores)
• Calculate revenue using quantity, unit price, and discounts
• Filter completed transactions only
• Aggregate results using Spark group-by operations

Example calculation:

daily_revenue_df = (
    orders_df
    .join(order_items_df, "order_id")
    .filter(col("order_status") == "Completed")
    .groupBy("order_date")
    .agg(
        spark_sum(
            col("quantity") * col("unit_price") * (1 - col("discount_pct"))
        ).alias("daily_revenue")
    )
)
### Gold Storage Structure

Gold datasets were written as Delta tables into ADLS:

gold/marts/daily_revenue
gold/marts/sales_by_store_daily
gold/marts/top_products_daily
gold/marts/customer_lifetime_value

Using Delta Lake ensures:

ACID transactions

Reliable data consistency

Faster analytical queries

Scalable data lakehouse architecture

### Example Business Insights

The Gold layer enables business questions such as:

• Which stores generate the most revenue?
• What are the top-selling products by day?
• How much revenue does each customer generate?
• What are the daily revenue trends?

These insights can easily feed Power BI dashboards or analytics tools.

 ### Technologies Used

• Delta Lake
• Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
• Azure Data Factory
• GitHub

# Day 7: Data Quality Checks

### Objective

Implemented data quality validations in Azure Databricks to ensure reliability of the Silver and Gold layers in the retail lakehouse architecture.

These validations help detect missing keys, duplicate records, invalid numeric values, broken relationships between tables, and business rule inconsistencies before the data is used for reporting and analytics.

### Data Quality Checks Implemented

#### 1. Null Checks

Validated that critical identifier columns contain no null values:

* `customers.customer_id`
* `products.product_id`
* `stores.store_id`
* `orders.order_id`
* `order_items.order_item_id`
* `payments.payment_id`

---

#### 2. Duplicate Checks

Validated that primary keys remain unique across all tables:

* `customer_id`
* `product_id`
* `store_id`
* `order_id`
* `order_item_id`
* `payment_id`

---

#### 3. Numeric & Range Validation

Validated business logic rules for numeric fields:

* `quantity > 0`
* `unit_price >= 0`
* `discount_pct between 0 and 1`
* `payment amount >= 0`

Safe casting (`try_cast`) was used for the `payments.amount` column because the field is stored as a string and may contain non-numeric values.

---

#### 4. Referential Integrity Checks

Ensured relationships between tables are valid:

* `order_items.order_id` exists in `orders`
* `payments.order_id` exists in `orders`
* `orders.customer_id` exists in `customers`
* `orders.store_id` exists in `stores`
* `order_items.product_id` exists in `products`

---

#### 5. Business Rule Validation

Validated operational consistency:

Completed orders should have corresponding payment records.

```
Completed Orders → Must have Payment
```

---

### Data Quality Summary Table

All validation results were aggregated into a summary table:

| check_name                        | failed_records |
| --------------------------------- | -------------- |
| null_customer_id                  | 0              |
| duplicate_order_id                | 0              |
| invalid_quantity                  | 0              |
| invalid_order_items_orders        | 0              |
| completed_orders_without_payments | 0              |

This provides a clear overview of pipeline health.

---

### Data Quality Results Storage

Validation results were optionally written to ADLS Gen2 as a Delta table:

```
gold/marts/data_quality_results
```

This enables monitoring of data quality over time.

---

### Technologies Used

* Azure Databricks
* PySpark
* Delta Lake
* Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

---

### Key Learning

This step demonstrates how to integrate **data quality validation into a modern lakehouse pipeline**. Ensuring data integrity before analytics prevents incorrect reporting and improves trust in downstream dashboards.
