All datasets are stored locally under:

data/sample_raw/
###  Bronze Layer Structure (ADLS)

Uploaded to Azure Data Lake:

bronze/raw/customers/
bronze/raw/products/
bronze/raw/stores/
bronze/raw/orders/
bronze/raw/order_items/
bronze/raw/payments/
Bronze Layer Rules

Raw data only

No transformations

No schema enforcement

Immutable storage

# Day 3 — Azure Data Factory Setup & Bronze Integration
## Goal

Establish Azure Data Factory (ADF) to orchestrate data ingestion from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS) Bronze layer.

This step introduces orchestration and enterprise-grade data pipeline design.

### Architecture (Updated)

Azure Data Factory (Orchestration Layer)

### Azure Resources Created
1️⃣ Azure Data Factory (V2)

Name: adf-retail-lakehouse

Resource Group: rg-retail-lakehouse-bharath

Region: Same as ADLS

System Assigned Managed Identity: Enabled

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

To allow ADF to access ADLS securely:

Assigned Role: Storage Blob Data Contributor

Assigned To: Azure Data Factory Managed Identity

This enables secure, password-less authentication using Azure RBAC.

### Linked Service Configuration

Created Linked Service:

Name: LS_ADLS_RETAIL

Type: Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

Authentication: Managed Identity

Connection Test: Successful

This establishes secure connectivity between ADF and ADLS.

### Datasets Created (Bronze Layer)

The following datasets were configured in ADF:

Dataset Name	Source Path
DS_Bronze_Customers_CSV	bronze/raw/customers/customers.csv
DS_Bronze_Products_CSV	bronze/raw/products/products.csv
DS_Bronze_Stores_CSV	bronze/raw/stores/stores.csv
DS_Bronze_Orders_CSV	bronze/raw/orders/orders.csv
DS_Bronze_OrderItems_CSV	bronze/raw/order_items/order_items.csv
DS_Bronze_Payments_CSV	bronze/raw/payments/payments.csv

Each dataset:

Uses DelimitedText format

Reads from ADLS Gen2

Schema imported from source

Header row enabled

 What This Demonstrates

✔ Azure Data Factory configuration
✔ Managed Identity authentication
✔ Secure RBAC role assignment
✔ Enterprise data connectivity
✔ Dataset design for structured ingestion

This step transitions the project from static storage to orchestrated data engineering.

### ADF Configuration Exported

ADF ARM Template exported and stored in repository:

adf/arm_template/
  ARMTemplateForFactory.json
  ARMTemplateParametersForFactory.json

This enables Infrastructure-as-Code capability and reproducibility.

# Day 4 — Parameterized ADF Pipeline (Reusable Bronze Ingestion)
🎯 Goal

Build a reusable Azure Data Factory (ADF) ingestion pattern using a single parameterized Copy pipeline to load any retail CSV file into the Bronze (raw) layer.

This implements an enterprise-style approach: build once, reuse for all datasets.

## Architecture (Updated)

ADLS Gen2 — Bronze Layer (Raw)

## What Was Built
### 1️) Parameterized Datasets (Source + Sink)

Created two ADLS Gen2 DelimitedText datasets with dynamic path support:

DS_ADLS_CSV_SRC_PARAM

DS_ADLS_CSV_SINK_PARAM

Each dataset uses parameters:

pContainer

pFolder

pFileName

This allows reading/writing files without creating separate datasets per table.

### 2️) Reusable Pipeline

Created a parameterized pipeline:

PL_CopyToBronze_Parameterized

Pipeline parameters:

pContainer (example: bronze)

pSourceFolder (example: raw/customers)

pFileName (example: customers.csv)

pTargetFolder (example: raw/customers)

Copy Activity:

Copy_CSV_To_Bronze

This pipeline supports ingestion for all retail datasets by changing parameter values.

### Validation Performed

Executed a Debug run for customers.csv

Confirmed successful copy execution in ADF Monitor

Verified file presence/updates in ADLS Bronze folder

### ADF Configuration Saved to Git

Exported ADF ARM template to track configuration in source control:

adf/arm_template/
  ARMTemplateForFactory.json
  ARMTemplateParametersForFactory.json
### Technologies Used

Azure Data Factory (Copy Activity, Parameterization)

ADLS Gen2 (Bronze Layer)

Managed Identity (RBAC)

GitHub + PowerShell

# Day 5 — Bronze to Silver Transformation (Azure Databricks + Delta Lake)
### Goal

Transform raw retail data from the Bronze layer into a cleaned and structured Silver layer using Azure Databricks and PySpark.

The Silver layer applies basic data engineering transformations to prepare the data for analytics.

Azure Data Lake Storage — Silver (Clean Delta Tables)

## Azure Databricks Setup

A minimal-cost Databricks cluster was created for data processing.

Setting	Value
Cluster Name	retail-cluster
Runtime	Databricks Runtime LTS
Worker Nodes	1
Auto Termination	15 minutes

Auto-termination ensures compute costs remain minimal.

## Databricks to ADLS Integration

Databricks was connected to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 using OAuth authentication.

Bronze and Silver storage paths:

Bronze Path
abfss://bronze@retaillakehousebharath.dfs.core.windows.net/raw/

Silver Path
abfss://silver@retaillakehousebharath.dfs.core.windows.net/clean/
### Datasets Processed

The following Bronze datasets were transformed:

Dataset	Description
customers	Customer information and loyalty tiers
products	Product catalog and pricing
stores	Store location details
orders	Order transactions
order_items	Product line items per order
payments	Payment details for orders
#### Transformations Applied

Basic data engineering transformations were implemented:

• Removed duplicate records
• Converted date columns to proper date format
• Cast numeric fields to correct data types
• Added ingestion timestamp (ingest_ts)
• Standardized schema structure

Example transformation:

customers_silver = (
customers_df
.dropDuplicates(["customer_id"])
.withColumn("signup_date", to_date("signup_date"))
.withColumn("ingest_ts", current_timestamp())
)
### Silver Layer Storage (Delta Format)

Processed datasets were written as Delta tables into the Silver layer.

silver/clean/customers
silver/clean/products
silver/clean/stores
silver/clean/orders
silver/clean/order_items
silver/clean/payments

Using Delta Lake provides:

ACID transactions

Schema enforcement

Faster queries

Reliable data versioning

### Data Validation

After transformations:

Row counts were verified

Schema structure confirmed

Data preview validated in Databricks notebook

### Technologies Used

• Azure Databricks
• PySpark
• Delta Lake
• Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
• Azure Data Factory
• GitHub
